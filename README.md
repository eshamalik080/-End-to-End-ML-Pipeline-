# Telco Churn Prediction Pipeline
This Projectp implements an end-to-end ML pipeline to predict customer churn using the Telco Churn dataset. It uses Scikit-learn Pipeline API and GridSearchCV to train Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.

## Features
- Data preprocessing(scaling, encoding) through pipeline
- Train the Logistic Regression & Random Forest models
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Export model using joblib

## How to use
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `train_pipeline.py` to train and save the model.
